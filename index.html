        <p>Hey all. My name is Sean. This is the first website I'm attempting to build through this workshop Hope to tell you more about it later. Maybe I'll expand more in 5 years when I'm a software developer or cloud engineer! Thanks for checking
          out
          the site. Take care!</p>

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <h4>Here are a list of folks who really helped me on this journey!</h4>
  <ul <li><strong>Eli The Computer Guy:</strong> This guys is aweosome. Luckily I found him when I was researching an intro to Cloud Computing. He's a great educator and his videos are very easy to understand. He covers so many topics and I really
    used
    him as an intro
    to pretty much any new subject I tried to tackle. Check out his videos on Youtube or at <a href="https://www.elithecomputerguy.com/">EliTheComputerGuy.com</a></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> and FreeCodeCamp:</strong>Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp: Both really good options for starting out. I used this as a jumping off point. Great community and good lessons. This is
      where I first got my feet wet.</li>
    <li><strong>Youtube Guy:</strong> This guy really broke down the path I should take to become a professional coder. Laid out a step by step road map instead of going to a bootcamp. Very genuine videos and opinions. It's so funny how all of this
      works because had
      I not stumbled across your video (I honestly don't even remember how I found it), I don't know if I ever would have seriously taken up coding. Thank you!</li>
    <li><strong>Udemy Angela:</strong>Finally, Angela at Udemy. As much as I liked codecademy and freecodecamp, I felt like I might not be moving at the pace I should be. I was looking for something with more instructional videos that would hopefully
      move me along
      quicker. I found you and you really put me over the top.</li>
